			<h3> We are Snack.Safe</h3>
			<p>
				<br>
				We, from Snacksafe, find it very important to be responsible for sustainable development along the innovation 
				value chain. We try to work on as many sustainable development goals as possible. Every small change or 
				adaptation which will develop the sustainability of the world will be taken into consideration and most of the 
				time be implemented. Sadly, we cannot support every single goal since we start as a pretty small company with 
				only one product. Our impact on society is relatively minimal but we still want to contribute to the 
				development of the world.

				Our production line is located in Vietnam. The average monthly salary of a worker in Vietnam is about 
				148 USD per month which translates to 0.85 euros per hour. With our hourly wage of 2,43 euros we pay almost three times 
				the average salary of a worker. With the significantly higher salary than the average worker we reduce the 
				inequalities salary wise with more developed countries (10. reduced inequalities) and stimulate the economic 
				growth (8. Decent work and economic growth). The respectively high salary could also have another benefit, 
				namely preventing child labour and making sure that they spend as much time in school as possible (4. Quality 
				education). By offering well paying jobs we also contribute a bit to end poverty in the world (1. No poverty).

				The main goal of our product Chefbox is preventing food waste. Wasting food is a big problem in today's world.
				Approximately 9,5 percent of our bought food disappears into the waste bin every year, which is on average 
				34,3 kilos of food per person per year. The chefbox will alarm the consumer when the product is almost over 
				due. This way we prevent food waste starting in the Netherlands and we can hopefully expand our business to 
				prevent food waste on a global level. By wasting less food we can use our food sources more efficiently and 
				exploit the earth less. Our comany is poised to addapt to the more stringent requirements that will
				be at the forefront of environmental policy and change in the future. We and our partners will come to see many
				years of prospects in both profits and possitive impacts to the globe.
